       "u\"Thanks! Now on to NYE makeup! [deleted] Right!? My face loves me, my wallet hates me.  Simple and Tasteful. :) Dipbrow is definitely something that has to be learned haha. I just barely stick the end of my brush into the pot and thats usually enough to cover my whole brow. But I also use the brow wiz first to outline my brows.  They look great on you, especially the red. How much do these cost if you don't mind me asking? Yeah she did that in high school...I've also recently read that she lied about being molested. Not sure how I feel about her now especially since she hardly does beauty vids anymore. She def is lacking when it comes to effort in her vids. I mixed a little of a Tarte stain (berry colored) with the baby lips clear chapstick, I've had the Tarte stain forever and the label is worn off so i dont know the exact color but i'll try and find out! and thank you!! Seriously. The recommendations for Gerard cosmetics need to chill the fuck out. Sona Gasparian's no makeup-makeup tutorial is the best one I've ever seen. Her YouTube username is makeupbysona.  You look awesome! I wish my eyebrows were that nice \\U0001f61e OH! well they're great and have a ton of eyelashes for super cheap I believe these ones are [jo jo](http://ohmy-lash.com/collections/new-sweetheart-collectiion/products/jo-jo) from the sweetheart collection, and it looks like they took down the subscription only option so you can \\nbuy them individually again! It doesn't take much water, I get my fingers wet with hot water and gently press my fingers together over my lashes.  No pulling, just touching them together around the lashes.  Agreed. Beauty gurus are lacking beauty vids and make up for it with hauls, q&amp;a's, sponsored vids, and vlogs. Those are cool every once in awhile but I watch beauty vids for help with beauty techniques, tutorials, and reviews on products I'm interested in. oh no! I love her, I hope it's just rumors :(\""
